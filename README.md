# Assignment3.1_RecursiveDice_AMM -This repository has a class that represents a pair of dice, in which both dive can be rolled for a value of 1 to 6. Random values are generated until the value is 2. There is also a main class that rolls the dice until the dice come up Snake Eyes(2). The RedDieRollerUpdate is changed to allow 100 rolls to occur as mentioned in the adjusted code, so you can run either RedDieRollerDriver or the Update to the number or rolls allowed.
